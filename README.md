OpenLeverage Protocol
=================

The OpenLeverage Protocol is smart contracts in Solidity for supplying or borrowing assets for leverage trading via DEX integration.

- Through provided API, anyone can create a pair of lending pools for a specific token pair.
- LToken, similar to CToken of Compound, is an interest-bearing ERC-20 token to received by the capital supplier when they *supply* ERC-20 tokens to the lending pools. The LToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates with a kinked model for borrowers.
- All margin trades will be executed against the liquidity pool of DEX, like Uniswap.
- Risk is calculated with real-time price from AMM.
- Liquidation is in two phases to avoid flash loan attacks and cascaded liquidation events.
